## Project Description
This project is part of Coursera’s Getting and Cleaning Data course. The goal was to obtain a tidy data set from a raw data set and submit the work through GitHub for peer review.
 
##Study design and data processing
 
###Collection of the raw data
Raw data used for this project can be downloaded from the following link:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
.
##Creating the tidy datafile
 
###Guide to create the tidy data file
Included in this repository is an R script that contains the sptes taken to transform the raw data set into the tidy data set. This file can be opened in RStudio and will download data, transform it according to instructions and create a file named averageData.txt which consists of the tidy data.
 
##Description of the variables in the averageData.txt file
 - Dimensions of the dataset: 180 observations, 68 variables
 - Variables present in the dataset:
 
###Variable 1 (repeat this section for all variables in the dataset)
Short description of what the variable describes.
 
Some information on the variable including:
 - Class of the variable
 - Unique values/levels of the variable
 - Unit of measurement (if no unit of measurement list this as well)
 - In case names follow some schema, describe how entries were constructed (for example time-body-gyroscope-z has 4 levels of descriptors. Describe these 4 levels). 
 
(you can easily use Rcode for this, just load the dataset and provide the information directly form the tidy data file)
