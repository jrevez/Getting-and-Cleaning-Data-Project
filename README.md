## Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project

This repository contains the result files for the course project of Cousera's Getting and Cleaning Data course.
Three files were included here for peer revision:

* README.md
* run_analysis.R - An R scrip with the 5 steps required to get from the raw to the tidy data set
* CodeBook.md - A markdown file with description of the variables in the data set as well as the step taken from the raw data to the tidy data set
